# Week 3 – Algorithms

Part of CS50x 2024 – Introduction to Computer Science by Harvard University

## Overview
This week was all about algorithms. We covered searching and sorting in more detail and learned about Big O notation to evaluate algorithm efficiency.

## Topics Covered
- Time complexity (Big O)
- Search algorithms (Binary Search)
- Sorting algorithms (Selection, Bubble, Insertion)
- Recursion

## Projects
- Tideman
- Plurality

## Key Takeaways
- Improved my understanding of algorithmic thinking.
- Gained hands-on experience implementing and debugging sorting logic.
- Learned how to compare algorithm efficiencies based on input size.

## Challenges
The Tideman voting system was particularly challenging due to its complex logic and need to prevent cycles in a directed graph. It strengthened my skills in using structured data and recursion.

## How to Run
```bash
gcc file.c -o output
./output
